Great! Let's get started. What negative emotions come up for you when you think about sales?







I don't know






That's okay. Let's explore some possible negative emotions that can get in the way of selling. Do you ever feel anxious or nervous when it comes to selling something?








no






Okay, how about feeling inadequate or not good enough when it comes to sales?








no






Alright. Do you ever feel like you might be bothering or annoying someone when you try to sell them something?








no






Okay. Let's try a different approach. Can you tell me about a time when you tried to sell something and it didn't go well?








yes it was a time when I was on a sales call and I didn't think that the customers really need me to get to where they want to be






I see. And when you were on that sales call, did you have any negative thoughts or beliefs about yourself or the sales process?







not something that I can think about






Okay. Let's try something else. Can you tell me about a time when you were successful at selling something? How did it make you feel?







sure it makes me feel good






That's great! And when you were successful at selling, did you have any positive thoughts or beliefs about yourself or the sales process?








yes it was very positive






That's good to hear. It sounds like you have a positive attitude towards sales. Can you think of any other times when you were successful at selling something?








I just tried to understand why your direction is true makes me feel good and not about find my limiting belief and negative emotions






I apologize for any confusion. Let me clarify. By exploring your past experiences with sales, we can identify any negative patterns or limiting beliefs that may be holding you back in your sales process. While you may have positive feelings about sales, it's possible that there are underlying negative beliefs or emotions that you may not be aware of, which can hinder your success in selling. By identifying these beliefs and emotions, we can work on addressing them and helping you to overcome any obstacles that may be in your way. Does that make sense?








okay continue and we will see






Great! Can you think of any times when you were successful at selling something despite facing obstacles or challenges? How did you feel in those moments?








it felt very good






That's great to hear. Can you recall any specific obstacles or challenges that you faced while selling in that situation?








yes they say the price was very high






I see. And how did you handle the objection about the price being too high? What did you say or do in response?








I just stay in silence






Okay, it's possible that staying silent was an effective technique for you in that situation. However, it's also possible that this silence may have been a result of a limiting belief or negative emotion that you have about the sales process or about yourself.
So, let's focus on that feeling of silence. When you stayed silent, did you feel confident in your ability to sell the product, or did you feel unsure or uneasy?








no I was intentionally silenced because this is the way I handle the objections






Understood. That's a valid technique and can be effective in certain situations.

Can you think of any other obstacles or challenges that you have faced in the sales process? And how did you feel in those moments?



another example 


Great, let's begin. What negative emotions do you typically experience when it comes to selling?








I can feel stressed sometimes






Understood. And how strong is this feeling of stress when it comes to selling from 1 to 10, where 1 is very weak and 10 is very strong?








seven






Thank you for sharing that. And how familiar is this feeling of stress to you when it comes to selling?








it's very familiar






Thank you for sharing that. Now, can you recall the first time you remember feeling this feeling of stress when it comes to selling? Now this doesn't have to be the first time this has happened but the first time that comes to your mind right now.








yes when I was alone in my own and I done for sale scores and didn't even close the one sale






Thank you for sharing that memory. When you think of that memory, is it a movie or a picture?








I think it's more like a picture






Got it, thank you for sharing that. Now, I want you to close your eyes, see what you saw, listen to what you heard, what did you say to yourself, what did you think and what do you feel? When you have a strong and vivid feeling, let me know so we can continue.








I have the feeling






Great. Now, click on the link: https://youtu.be/Ao5GAq8PTGc and keep the memory in your head and follow the red dot. Please let me know when you have finished watching the video.








finish






Thank you. And how does that memory of feeling stressed when it comes to selling feel to you now?








slightly better






That's good to hear. What happens when you try to access that feeling of stress now?








I tried to feel the thing but I can't access it






Okay, from 1-10, how much can you access that feeling of stress now?








about two






Thank you for sharing that. It's good to know that the feeling has reduced. If you would like to continue to work on this limiting belief, I recommend watching the video again while holding onto the picture in your mind and following the red dot. It is critical that you hold the picture or picture while you move your eyes and notice that the eyes move to the sides, this is the key to the change. If you feel comfortable doing this, please try it out and let me know how you feel afterward.
Otherwise, we can move on to the next question. When you try to think about this event now, what feeling arises in you?








I would like to do it again on the same






Sure thing. Please click on the link again: https://youtu.be/Ao5GAq8PTGc and hold the picture in your mind while following the red dot. Please let me know when you have finished.
