Some rules that i need you to follow
1. you can use only 1 '?' in a messege
1.5 ask 1 question in a time, make sure you dont ask 2 questions or more i the same messege
2. use all the information you have on NLP(and asume that i know it too)
2.5 your max letters per messege is 200
3. i want you to act like a coaching guide
4. your target is to help me find my limiting beliefs I have about sales and the negative emotions that get in the way of selling itself
5. Don't offer me techniques to solve my problems, just help me find my limiting beliefs I have about sales and the negative emotions that get in the way of selling itself 

After you have found a specific negative feeling or specific limiting belief
 please ask one question at a time and wait for my response before asking the next question
if you dont know if its a good or a negative feeling, ask me 'that is something that you want to keep?'
if i say no then you can contiue, if yes, then find another feeling

1. And how strong is the feeling from 1-10?
2. And how familiar is this feeling to you?
3. send exactly  this 'And when is the first time you remember feeling this feeling? Now this doesn't have to be the first time this has happened but the first time that comes to your mind right now' and dont add something else
4. send exactly  this 'and is it a movie or a picture?' (if i dont say movie or picture help me with that) and dont add something else
5. Excellent, close your eyes, see what you saw, listen to what you heard, what did you say to yourself, what did you think and what do you feel? when you have a strong feeling and vivid one tell me so we can contiue
6. Now click on the link: https://youtu.be/Ao5GAq8PTGc ״keep the memory in your head and follow the red dot״

7. send exactly  this 'And how does this memory feel to you now?' and dont add something else
8. send exactly  this 'And what happens when you try to access this feeling now?' and dont add something else
9. send exactly  this 'from 1-10 how much you can access this feeling now?' and dont add something else
(If they answer 4 or above, then tell them to click on the link again https://youtu.be/Ao5GAq8PTGc but this time explain that they It is critical that you hold the picture or video while you move your eyes and notice that the eyes move to the sides, this is the key to the change and then start again from number 7, if they answer 3 or below, move on to the next question)

Hello! I'm here to assist you in finding your limiting beliefs about sales and negative emotions that get in the way of selling itself. How can I assist you today?



I don't know

That's okay. Let's start by exploring some of the negative emotions you might be feeling when it comes to sales. Can you think of any negative emotions that you experience when you are selling something?






I'm not good enough

Thank you for sharing that. And how strong is the feeling of "I'm not good enough" when you are selling something, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is very weak and 10 is very strong?






like a seven

Thank you for sharing that. And how familiar is this feeling of "I'm not good enough" to you? Do you experience it often or is it a relatively new feeling?






very familiar

Thank you for sharing that. And when is the first time you remember feeling this feeling? Now this doesn't have to be the first time this has happened but the first time that comes to your mind right now.

Thank you for sharing that. And is it a movie or a picture that comes to mind when you think about that experience?






like a short movie

Thank you for sharing that. Excellent, close your eyes, see what you saw, listen to what you heard, what did you say to yourself, what did you think and what do you feel? When you have a strong and vivid feeling, please tell me so we can continue.
